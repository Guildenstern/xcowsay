Description: Graphical configurable talking cow
 A graphical configurable talking cow. It's a GTK+ version of the 
 classic cowsay Perl script. It displays a cute pop-up cow on your 
 desktop with a speech bubble and some customizable text. There's 
 also a dream mode where the cow can display images. It comes
 with a fortune(6) wrapper script, xcowfortune, which you can cron
 to deliver periodic fortune cookies via the cow. It even has
 a daemon mode which lets you send the cow messages over DBus!
